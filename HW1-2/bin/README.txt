Sabrina Hussaini - Homework 1 - Roster Program

For this homework, I decided to stick with the first option because I found it 
a lot more simpler. Personally, it was easier for me to make a reference to the head
and to the tail rather than doing it separately. This way you can access it easily. 


1. The doubly linked list class has a purpose of using a linked list of type T to create 
a double linked list of type T. The methods in this class will properly 
delete, and add at specific places in the nodes. It also 
has all of the setters and getters which are created to help the program run. 
It uses head and tail to set nodes in proper places. 


2. The doubly linked list node class just deals with the doubly linked list node. It creates a getter 
 for previous node and a setter for previous node.
 
3. The homework 1 class has my file reader where it uses scanner to read the file
 created that has the names but also has the input that the user wants. 
 
4.The roaster program class was in control of the roaster program. It would add, remove, and put the roaster in alphabetical order. 
The methods in this class were written to where the add method would take in where a specific node would be put in place. 
Meaning if it was in the beginning, the middle, or the end of a doubly linked list. The sort method had a purpose 
of correctly sorting the list but making sure it did not sort a list if it was in the waitlist students list. 
The remove method would correctly remove a node when the user would tell it to. And it would make sure to 
remove a node but add the waitlist node into the registered list if there was room.
